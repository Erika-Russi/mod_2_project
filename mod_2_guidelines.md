### Module 2 Projects

Welcome to Module 2 projects! You are assigned to a pair and will have until Thursday evening to work on the projects. The end of module Science Fair will be on Friday afternoon.

Projects are designed to review the material we covered in Module 2:

* cleaning data with numpy and pandas
* probability and combinatorics
* probability distributions
* hypothesis testing
* simple linear regression
* multiple linear regression
* cross validation and the bias/variance tradeoff

Ask a main question with which you can use a regression to answer. The other topics we learned in Module 2 can be used as further justification for your answers to subsequent questions.

Sample Questions:

* What best determines the final auction price of an item?
* What are the key factors in determining a country's happiness level?
* Is there a way we can predict the spread of a football game?


### Data
* You must have at least 4 different features in your models (independent variables) with at least one target (dependent variable).
* Your data must contain at least one categorical feature and at least one numerical feature
* **BONUS**: Challenge yourself to obtain a unique dataset (either from webscraping or querying APIs)

### The Deliverables

1. ** A well documented Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project, comments explaining it, and graphical visualizations.

## Requirements

#### Organization/Code Cleanliness

* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow,  and code should be commented where appropriate.  
    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation
* The notebook is written for a technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.

#### Visualizations & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

* Your project contains at least 4 _meaningful_ data visualizations, with corresponding interpretations. All visualizations are well labeled with axes labels, a title, and a legend (when appropriate)  
* You pose at least 3 meaningful questions and answer them through EDA.  These questions should be well labeled and easy to identify inside the notebook.
    * **Level Up**: Each question is clearly answered with a visualization that makes the answer easy to understand.   
* Your notebook should contain 1 - 2 paragraphs briefly explaining your approach to this project.


#### Model Quality/Approach

* Your model should not include any predictors with p-values greater than .05 (unless you can justify)
* Your model should have cross-validation and account for the bias-variance tradeoff  
* Your notebook shows an iterative approach to modeling, and details the parameters and results of the model at each iteration.  
    * **Level Up**: Whenever necessary, you briefly explain the changes made from one iteration to the next, and why you made these choices.  
* You provide at least 1 paragraph explaining your final model.
